# Context Session: Login Feature

## Project Overview

CrossFit class reservation app for AimHarder - automatically books classes when they become available (4 days before class date).

## Feature Requirements

- Responsive login page design for mobile and desktop
- High-quality UX/UI design using shadcn components
- Themed color scheme (no pure colors, cohesive theming)
- Mobile-first approach since this is primarily a mobile app

## Initial Analysis

- Tech Stack: NextJs, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, ShadcnUI
- Architecture: Feature-based with screaming architecture principles
- Database: Supabase (likely for authentication)

## Design Goals

- Professional, modern CrossFit-themed design
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
- Consistent theming that will be used throughout the app
- Focus on usability for quick mobile interactions

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current project structure ✓
2. Consult with UX/UI and shadcn experts for design recommendations ✓
3. Create a plan and wireframe for the login page design ✓
4. Review and correct architecture to follow CLAUDE.md guidelines ✓
5. Create themed login page with proper responsive design
6. Implement theming system for consistent app-wide design
7. Test across different screen sizes

## Architecture Corrections Applied

### Fixed Structure to Follow CLAUDE.md Guidelines:
- **Pod Structure**: Created proper login pod with container/component separation
- **API Layer**: Separated services, mappers, and models following feature architecture
- **Business Logic**: Clear separation between business logic and UI components
- **Models**: Proper Zod schemas for type safety and validation
- **Hooks**: Feature-specific hooks following naming conventions

### Corrected File Structure:
```
modules/auth/
├── api/
│   ├── services/auth.service.ts
│   ├── mappers/auth.mapper.ts
│   └── models/auth.api.ts
├── business/auth.business.ts
├── pods/login/
│   ├── login.container.tsx (Server Component)
│   ├── login.component.tsx (Client Component)
│   ├── components/login-form.tsx
│   ├── models/login.model.ts (Zod schemas)
│   └── hooks/useLogin.hook.tsx
├── models/auth.model.ts
├── utils/auth.utils.ts
└── constants/auth.constants.ts
```

### Subagent Recommendations Applied:
- **shadcn-ui-architect**: login-02 block, CrossFit theme, mobile-first design
- **Architecture**: Feature-based structure with screaming architecture principles
- **Complete plan**: .claude/doc/login/shadcn_ui.md (updated with correct structure)

## Implementation Results ✅

### Successfully Implemented:
1. **shadcn/ui Setup**: ✅ Initialized with CrossFit theme
2. **Architecture Structure**: ✅ Created proper feature-based module structure
3. **Login Page**: ✅ Responsive design with mobile-first approach
4. **Authentication Flow**: ✅ Complete login system with form validation
5. **CrossFit Theme**: ✅ Professional blue/orange/green color scheme
6. **Development Server**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:3002

### File Structure Created:
```
✅ modules/auth/
  ✅ api/ (services, mappers, models)
  ✅ pods/login/ (container, component, form, hooks, models)
✅ common/ui/ (shadcn components)
✅ app/login/page.tsx
✅ app/dashboard/page.tsx (redirect target)
✅ CrossFit theme in globals.css
```

### Features Working:
- ✅ Mobile-responsive login form
- ✅ Form validation with Zod schemas
- ✅ Mock authentication service
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ CrossFit-themed UI with professional design
- ✅ Automatic redirect to dashboard on success

### Ready for Enhancement:
- OAuth integration (Google/Apple)
- Real backend API connection
- Session management
- Form validation enhancement with react-hook-form

## Notes

- App will handle automatic class reservations when availability opens
- User experience should be seamless for busy CrossFit athletes
- Authentication likely through Supabase
- Architecture now properly follows screaming architecture principles
