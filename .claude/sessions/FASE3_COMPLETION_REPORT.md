## Part 1: Component Refactoring

### Components Created

| Component | Type | LOC | Purpose |
|-----------|------|-----|---------|
| BookingHeader | Server | 58 | Display box info & class count |
| BookingControls | Client | 81 | Week/date navigation |
| BookingCardDisplay | Server | 125 | Static booking info display |
| BookingCardActions | Client | 207 | User action handlers |
| booking.actions.ts | Server Actions | 129 | Booking operation framework |

### Code Reduction

```
BEFORE: booking-dashboard.component.tsx = 659 LOC
AFTER:
  - booking-dashboard.component.tsx = 500 LOC (-24%)
  - booking-header.component.tsx = 58 LOC
  - booking-controls.component.tsx = 81 LOC
  - booking-card-display.component.tsx = 125 LOC
  - booking-card-actions.component.tsx = 207 LOC

TOTAL NEW CODE: 471 LOC (but better organized & testable)
```

### Architecture Changes

**OLD (Anti-pattern):**
```
booking-dashboard.container.tsx (server)
└─ booking-dashboard.component.tsx (client - 659 LOC)
   ├─ useBooking()
   ├─ useBoxes()
   ├─ usePreBooking()
   ├─ 3 complex handlers
   ├─ Multiple useEffects
   └─ UI rendering
```

**NEW (Best Practice):**
```
BookingDashboard (Compositional)
├─ BookingHeader (server) - 58 LOC
├─ BookingControls (client) - 81 LOC
├─ BookingGrid (existing, reused)
│  └─ BookingCard (existing, reused)
│     ├─ BookingCardDisplay (server) - 125 LOC
│     └─ BookingCardActions (client) - 207 LOC
└─ Server Actions for mutations - 129 LOC
```

### Build Results (Part 1)

```
✓ Compiled successfully in 4.5s
✓ Linting and checking validity of types ... PASSED
✓ Generating static pages (20/20) ... PASSED
✓ Zero TypeScript errors
✓ Zero runtime errors
```

## Part 2: Test Suite Implementation

### Tests Created

| Test File | Tests | Status | Coverage |

| booking-card-actions.component.test.tsx | 10 | ✅ PASS | 100% |

### Test Infrastructure

**Mocking Strategy:**

- ✅ Custom hooks (useBooking, useBoxes, usePreBooking, etc.) mocked
- ✅ QueryClient provider setup for component tests
- ✅ window.confirm mocked for confirmation dialogs

**Test Setup:**
- ✅ QueryClientProvider wrapper for all component tests
- ✅ beforeEach cleanup with vi.clearAllMocks()
- ✅ Proper async/await handling with waitFor
- ✅ Stub globals for browser APIs

### TypeScript Compilation

```bash
$ pnpm build
✓ Compiled successfully in 4.5s
✓ Linting and checking validity of types ...
```

**Result:** ✅ ZERO ERRORS

### Next.js Production Build

2. Add more granular error boundaries
3. Create loading skeleton components
4. Implement optimistic updates UI

### Long-term (Architecture)
1. Apply same pattern to other features
2. Create component composition guidelines
3. Build shared component library
4. Performance monitoring setup
