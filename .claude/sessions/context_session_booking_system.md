# Booking System Implementation Session

## Initial Analysis

### Feature Overview
Implementing a booking system that allows users to reserve classes through a POST request to the AimHarder API. This focuses on the backend integration and booking logic.

### API Details
- **Endpoint**: `https://crossfitcerdanyola300.aimharder.com/api/book`
- **Method**: POST
- **Parameters**:
  - `day`: Format YYYYMMDD (e.g., 20250929)
  - `familyId`: Empty string
  - `id`: Slot ID (not classID)
  - `insist`: 0

### Response Scenarios
1. **Success Response** (bookState: 1):
   ```json
   {
     "clasesContratadas": "BARBELL WOD, CONDITIONING, GYMNASTICS, HALTEROFILIA, OPEN BOX, RUN CLUB, Strength&Accesories, TEAM WOD, WOD",
     "hasPublicMemberships": 1,
     "bookState": 1,
     "id": "106015104"
   }
   ```

2. **Early Booking Error** (bookState: -12):
   ```json
   {
     "clasesContratadas": "BARBELL WOD, CONDITIONING, GYMNASTICS, HALTEROFILIA, OPEN BOX, RUN CLUB, Strength&Accesories, TEAM WOD, WOD",
     "bookState": -12,
     "errorMssg": "No puedes reservar clases con m√°s de 4 d√≠as de antelaci√≥n",
     "errorMssgLang": "ERROR_ANTELACION_CLIENTE"
   }
   ```

3. **Max Bookings Reached Error** (bookState: -8):
   ```json
   {
     "clasesContratadas": "BARBELL WOD, CONDITIONING, GYMNASTICS, HALTEROFILIA, OPEN BOX, RUN CLUB, Strength&Accesories, TEAM WOD, WOD",
     "bookState": -8,
     "max": 2
   }
   ```

### Requirements
1. Create booking API service with proper error handling
2. Handle success and error responses appropriately
3. Update class state after successful booking
4. Calculate when booking becomes available for future scheduled bookings
5. Integrate with existing authentication system
6. Create proper data models and types for booking responses

### Implementation Strategy
- Need to analyze existing API structure and authentication flow
- Create booking service in appropriate module following feature-based architecture
- Implement proper error handling and state management
- Consider future cron-based booking feature requirements

### Current Implementation Analysis
**Existing Structure:**
- ‚úÖ Booking module exists with feature-based architecture
- ‚úÖ GET `/api/booking` route implemented for fetching bookings
- ‚úÖ Authentication flow using SupabaseSessionService with real cookies
- ‚úÖ BookingService class for API calls (currently only GET)
- ‚úÖ Complete data models and mappers (booking.api.ts, booking.model.ts)
- ‚úÖ Constants defined (booking.constants.ts)
- ‚úÖ Error handling with BookingApiError class

**Missing Components for POST Booking:**
- ‚ùå POST method in `/app/api/booking/route.ts`
- ‚ùå API models for booking request/response (POST /api/book)
- ‚ùå Service method in BookingService for making reservations
- ‚ùå Mapper for booking response to handle bookState and error scenarios

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Uses SupabaseSessionService.getSession() for authentication
- Follows external API pattern: `https://crossfitcerdanyola300.aimharder.com/api/book`
- Must handle success (bookState: 1), early booking errors (bookState: -12), and max bookings errors (bookState: -8)
- Need to calculate future booking availability from error messages
- Should update local booking state after successful reservation

### Current Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Analyzed existing codebase structure and authentication flow
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive architectural analysis completed
- ‚úÖ Implementation strategy defined for POST booking functionality

### Architecture Analysis Results

**Existing Structure Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ GET `/app/api/booking/route.ts` - Working API proxy with SupabaseSessionService auth
- ‚úÖ `BookingService` class - Complete service with error handling and validation
- ‚úÖ Zod schemas - `BookingResponseApiSchema` and `BookingRequestParamsSchema` defined
- ‚úÖ Error handling - `BookingApiError` class with proper classification
- ‚úÖ Constants - `BOOKING_CONSTANTS` with API endpoints and configurations
- ‚úÖ Authentication flow - SupabaseSessionService with cookie-based external API auth

**POST Implementation Strategy:**
1. **API Route Extension**: Extend existing `/app/api/booking/route.ts` with POST method
2. **New API Models**: Create `BookingCreateRequestSchema` and `BookingCreateResponseSchema`
3. **Service Enhancement**: Add `createBooking` method to `BookingService` class
4. **Error Handling**: Two-tier approach - HTTP errors + bookState business logic errors
5. **Validation**: Zod schema validation for request body with proper error responses

**Key Implementation Details:**
- POST endpoint: `https://crossfitcerdanyola300.aimharder.com/api/book`
- Request format: `{day: "YYYYMMDD", familyId: "", id: "slotId", insist: 0}`
- Success response: `bookState: 1` with booking ID
- Error response: `bookState: -12` with error message and language key
- Authentication: Same cookie forwarding pattern as GET implementation
