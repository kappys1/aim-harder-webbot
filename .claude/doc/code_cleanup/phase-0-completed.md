**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Duration**: ~30 minutes

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Dependencies Installed
All testing dependencies successfully installed via pnpm:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.9.1",
    "@testing-library/react": "^16.3.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.6.1",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^5.0.4",
    "@vitest/coverage-v8": "^3.2.4",
    "@vitest/ui": "^3.2.4",
    "happy-dom": "^19.0.2",
    "msw": "^2.11.3",
    "vitest": "^3.2.4"
  }
}
```

### 2. Vitest Configuration
Created `vitest.config.ts` with:
- ✅ happy-dom environment for fast DOM testing
- ✅ Coverage thresholds: 80% lines, 80% functions, 75% branches
- ✅ Path aliases (@/ → project root)
- ✅ Test file patterns (*.test.ts, *.spec.tsx)
- ✅ Coverage exclusions (node_modules, .next, dist, tests, config files)

### 3. Test Scripts Added to package.json
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest",
    "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
    "test:coverage": "vitest --coverage",
    "test:watch": "vitest --watch"
  }
}
```

### 4. Test Setup File
Created `tests/setup.ts` with:
- ✅ Testing Library cleanup after each test
- ✅ Mock environment variables
- ✅ Next.js module mocks (navigation, headers, cookies)

### 5. Test Utilities
Created `tests/utils/test-utils.tsx` with:
- ✅ Custom render function with providers
- ✅ QueryClient factory for isolated tests
- ✅ AllTheProviders wrapper (React Query)

### 6. Mock Fixtures
Created test fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`:
- ✅ `auth.fixtures.ts` - Auth cookies, session data, login responses
- ✅ `booking.fixtures.ts` - Bookings, booking days, API responses

### 7. Directory Structure
```
tests/
  ├── fixtures/          # Mock data
  │   ├── auth.fixtures.ts
  │   └── booking.fixtures.ts
  ├── mocks/             # MSW handlers (to be created)
  ├── utils/             # Test utilities
  │   └── test-utils.tsx
  ├── setup.ts           # Global test setup
  └── setup.test.ts      # Verification test
```

## 📊 Current Test Coverage: **0.05%**

### Coverage Report (Baseline):
```
File               | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines
-------------------|---------|----------|---------|--------
All files          |    0.05 |    48.21 |   48.21 |    0.05
```

**Analysis**:
- Only setup test exists (3 passing tests)
- **0% coverage** on actual application code
- 48% branch/function coverage is from untested files being scanned
- **Ready to start Phase 1** (critical path tests)

---

## ✅ Verification Test Results

```bash
pnpm test -- --run
```

**Output**:
```
 ✓ tests/setup.test.ts (3 tests) 2ms

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  3 passed (3)
   Duration  534ms
```

**Tests**:
1. ✅ Basic test execution
2. ✅ Environment variables accessible
3. ✅ Math operations work

---

## 🎯 Next Steps: Phase 1

**Goal**: Reach **60% coverage** with critical path tests

### Priority Tests to Write:

1. **Auth Module** (5-7 hours)
   - [ ] `auth.service.test.ts` - Login, logout, session check
   - [ ] `aimharder-auth.service.test.ts` - External auth, rate limiting
   - [ ] `aimharder-refresh.service.test.ts` - Token refresh, setrefresh
   - [ ] `cookie.service.test.ts` - Cookie extraction, validation
   - [ ] `supabase-session.service.test.ts` - Session CRUD

2. **Booking Module** (4-5 hours)
   - [ ] `booking.service.test.ts` - Get, create, cancel bookings
   - [ ] `booking.business.test.ts` - Business logic, caching, validation
   - [ ] `booking.mapper.test.ts` - API ↔ Domain transformation
   - [ ] `booking.utils.test.ts` - Date formatting, filtering, sorting

3. **Prebooking Module** (3-4 hours)
   - [ ] `prebooking.service.test.ts` - CRUD, claiming, race conditions
   - [ ] `prebooking-scheduler.business.test.ts` - FIFO execution, timing
   - [ ] `error-parser.utils.test.ts` - Early booking error parsing

4. **Hooks** (2-3 hours)
   - [ ] `useBooking.hook.test.tsx` - Data fetching, caching
   - [ ] `useAuth.hook.test.tsx` - Authentication state
   - [ ] `usePreBooking.hook.test.tsx` - Prebooking mutations

## 📝 Notes

### What Works:
- ✅ Test environment is fully functional
- ✅ Vitest runs successfully
- ✅ Coverage reporting works
- ✅ Mock fixtures are ready to use
- ✅ Test utilities are available

### What's Next:
- Start Phase 1 with auth module tests
- Create MSW handlers for API mocking
- Add fixtures for prebooking and boxes
- Aim for 60% coverage before refactoring

### Estimated Timeline:
- Phase 1: 12-15 hours (critical paths)
- Phase 2: 8-10 hours (service layer)
- Phase 3: 6-8 hours (integration)
- **Total to 80% coverage: ~30-35 hours** (1-1.5 weeks full-time)
