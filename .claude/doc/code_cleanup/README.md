## 📊 Current State (2025-10-04)

### Testing Infrastructure
- ❌ No tests exist
- ❌ No testing framework configured
- ❌ No test coverage (0%)
- ❌ No CI/CD testing pipeline

### Codebase Statistics
- **Total Files**: ~112 TypeScript files
- **Modules**: 4 (auth, booking, prebooking, boxes)
- **Services**: ~20
- **Hooks**: 11
- **Components**: 15
- **Utils**: 7

### Risk Level
🔴 **HIGH RISK** - Zero test coverage means refactoring could break production

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Minimum Viable Testing (Before Refactoring)
- ✅ 60% code coverage
- ✅ All critical paths tested (auth, booking, prebooking)
- ✅ Zero test failures
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline runs tests

### Ideal Testing (Recommended)
- ✅ 80%+ code coverage
- ✅ All services tested
- ✅ Integration tests for API routes
- ✅ Visual regression baseline
- ✅ Team trained on testing practices

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

### Testing Framework
- **Vitest** - Fast, modern test runner (Jest-compatible)
- **React Testing Library** - User-centric component testing
- **Testing Library User Event** - Realistic user interactions

### Mocking & Utilities
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** - API mocking
- **jsdom** - DOM environment for tests
- **@vitest/coverage-v8** - Code coverage reports

### Why These Tools?
- ✅ Fast execution (Vitest is faster than Jest)
- ✅ ESM support (native ES modules)
- ✅ Great DX (developer experience)
- ✅ Industry standard (RTL best practice)
- ✅ Next.js compatible

## 📖 Key Principles

### Testing Philosophy
1. **Test behavior, not implementation** - Tests should survive refactoring
2. **User-centric testing** - Test what users see and do
3. **Isolation** - Each test should be independent
4. **Clarity** - Tests are documentation
5. **Coverage quality > quantity** - Critical paths first

### Testing Trophy
```
    /\
   /  \    E2E (Few)
  /----\   Integration (More)
 /------\  Unit (Most)
----------
```

**Our approach**: Focus on integration tests that provide most confidence

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### DON'T Start Refactoring Without Tests
**Why?** Zero test coverage means:
- No safety net for changes
- High risk of breaking production
- No way to verify behavior preservation
- Difficult to catch regressions

### DON'T Skip Phase 0 (Setup)
**Why?** Without proper infrastructure:
- Tests will be inconsistent
- Mocking will be difficult
- Coverage reports won't work
- Developer experience will be poor

### DON'T Test Implementation Details
**Why?** Tests will break on refactoring:
- Component internal state
- Private methods
- CSS class names
- DOM structure details

**DO Test** user-visible behavior:
- What users see
- What users click
- What happens when they interact
- Error messages shown

## 💡 Final Notes

> **Remember**: Testing is an investment, not a cost. The time spent writing tests now will save exponentially more time debugging production issues later.

> **Important**: Do NOT start refactoring until coverage reaches at least 60%. The risks are too high.

> **Pro Tip**: Start with Phase 1 (critical paths). Getting auth and booking tested gives the most value for time invested.
